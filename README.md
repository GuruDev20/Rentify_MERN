# Rentify: A House Rental System using MERN Stack

Rentify is a web application built to facilitate the rental process for both landlords (sellers) and tenants (users). It provides a platform where landlords can list their properties for rent, manage stocks, and handle transactions securely. Tenants can browse through available properties, make payments, and book rentals hassle-free.

- **Seller Dashboard**: Sellers can manage their properties, add new stocks, update property details, and monitor rental transactions.
- **User Dashboard**: Tenants can browse listings, view property details, make payments using Razorpay, and manage their rental agreements.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can search for properties based on location, price range, amenities, etc., making it easier to find the perfect rental.
- **Booking and Payment**: Rentify integrates Razorpay for seamless payment processing, allowing users to pay securely for their rental bookings.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Users receive real-time notifications for booking confirmations, payment receipts, and other important updates.
- **Responsive Design**: Rentify is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
